# myApp

Using Html, css, js creates a simple handwriting recognition web app.
The purpose of this app is to show the procedure of basic character recognition based on Template Matching.

The layout is quite simple. It consists of two sections. The top section displays the Templates I Created for the app. The bottom section consists of draw character area and result area. These two areas are both the <canvas> tag.


Once the all resources were downloaded, you can write the character in the draw character section (bottom left corner of the screen). Press down the left button on the mouse, hold and drag on the screen to write the number. Finish pressing the mouse will trigger the result area which displays a bar chart to indicate the similarity with individual character from Templates. (I use a predefined value to illustrate the functionality)

Press the "show the process" button will show a popup that demonstrates the procedure.
